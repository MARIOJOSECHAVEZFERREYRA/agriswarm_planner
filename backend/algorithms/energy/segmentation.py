    """
    Pure ordered-route slicer: splits a typed route into work cycles
    based on drone energy and liquid budget, without reordering the
    input. Preserves the exact sequence produced upstream by the
    PathAssembler.

    Pipeline
    --------
    1. Expand multi-point route segments into atomic 2-point segments,
       copying every piece of metadata (cell_id, spraying, type, ...).
    2. Group atomic segments into SPATIAL RUNS — maximal contiguous
       slices of the route that stay inside one work area. A run ends
       whenever the route crosses a natural boundary:
         * cell_id transitions from one cell to another
         * a ferry/deadhead whose length exceeds a spatial threshold
           (long translations across the field)
    3. Pack runs into cycles respecting the energy/liquid budget and a
       reserved return-to-base margin. Cycles are preferred to close
       at run boundaries so a single cycle never contains work in two
       disconnected areas of the field. A cycle only splits INSIDE a
       run when that run on its own exceeds a full battery cycle.

            a "bridge" segment connecting two distant work areas.

        Long ferries are NOT automatically dropped here. Instead,
        the bridge is attached to the following run via the
        ``bridge_before`` field. The cycle packer then decides:
          * If the next run (bridge + segments) still fits in the
            current cycle's energy/liquid budget, the bridge is
            emitted inside the cycle and the drone keeps working.
          * If the next run does not fit, the packer closes the
            current cycle, drops the bridge, and opens a fresh
            cycle at the first non-bridge segment of the run.
